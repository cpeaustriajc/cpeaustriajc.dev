My blog, and the list of projects that I created all in a single page
in this digital space.

This is also mostly a digital playground to experiment with the latest
html, css, and javascript features, the only abstraction that this site
has is astro, which there isn't much abstraction and I can opt in to
a plain html if I wanted to.
