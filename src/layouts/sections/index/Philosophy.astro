		<p class="text-2xl">
			My main philosophy about programming is to make <strong
				>programming as simple as possible
			</strong>, The computer can only understand Ones and Zeros, there shouldn't be any kind
			of complex system or design that is working under the hood of a program that will make
			it harder than it is for the computer to understand.
