		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			I am a student in Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng San Pablo that is passionate about
			programming.
		</p>

		<p>
			I am currently studying and taking a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering
			(BSCpE). I am really fascinated about computers, the amount of things that you can do
			are almost limitless and I am always fascinated by the fact that these are only just a
			bunch of switches that turn on and off!
		</p>
		<p>
			Even though we only understand the basic components of them, we still need people to
			understand the underlying parts of it. This is where my college specialization shines.
		</p>
		<p>
			I love trying out different kinds of technologies and what are their limits and what can
			I do with them.
