# About

I am a programmer based in Laguna, PH. I am currently studying at Pamantasan ng
Lungsod ng San Pablo.

I started programming in 2016 by playing around with computer graphics and
creating shader configurations in various games. Since then, I learned multiple
programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools. I am currently focusing
on web development because I believe that the web is the future and investing in
it is a good idea.

I wanted to be a part of a community where there is something always new in the
corner and something that hypes me up everytime.
