This is honestly something that I did not expect at all, but I have made a
realization that I have a very unhealthy work ethic where sometimes I would
work more than the amount of hours that I was expected to do. I have caught
this trait of me early in my career, specifically in my current internship.

I must admit, the work that I was presented with was not easy, As of this
writing, I am handling all of the roles that is needed to finish a whole
project. Which is basically what a freelancer would probably do. But this
is kind of different, for someone who has done freelance work. This is
another level, I would say that I am going above and beyond on what the
scope of an intern should do.

And this is very taxing for my mental health as I was always the one who
had highly expected by other people, and for some reason looked up to me
as if I have my life figured out, there are some bits and pieces of me
that is already solved or should I say my life puzzles are slowly coming
together, but there is still some missing pieces left to be found in this
vast and unknown world.

Something that should be removed from my list of unhealthy habits is
going beyond on what I am responsible for. For someone who enjoys coding
this is unhealthy, mixing what should be the hours where I should be
enjoying my free time and actual work is blurring because I am instead
doing what is beyond my responsibilities.

I needed to learn how to balance my work-life hours and needed to learn
how to live life, enjoy and cherish every moment of it. Good thing about
it is that there are some special people in my life that taught me that
and I am forever grateful that they existed and decided to enter my life
and teaching my how to live it.

For someone who has lived almost his entire life in the digital world.
Living outside of it has been really an epiphany for me. And I am doing
better than I was before.
