Astro just released another major version supporting the most
anticipated feature called the `View Transitions API` and the
Image Optimization API previously introduced as the `assets`
directory back in its experimental stage.

Let's take a look at what these new API can offer.

## View Transitions

View Transitions are not specifically created for Astro but
they are a web standard feature that Astro just so happens
to be the first major web framework to support it.

The concept is that it unlocks native browser transition
effects between pages.

Here's an example that is taken on how I implemented it
on my personal portfolio.

On `src/components/BaseSEO.astro`:

```astro
---
// src/components/BaseSEO.astro
// Added it to the common head tags so that it
// can be reused throughout the layouts
import {ViewTransitions} from 'astro:transitions';
---

<meta charset="utf-8" />
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-touch-icon.png" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/favicon-32x32.png" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/favicon-16x16.png" />
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />
<ViewTransitions />
```

Then, I added it to the `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`

```astro
---
// src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro
// Add the BaseSEO components to the top level <head> tag
import BaseSEO from '~/components/BaseSEO.astro'
---

<html dir="ltr" lang="en">
  <head>
    <BaseHead />
    <!-- Rest of the head tags... -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <slot />
  </body>
</html>
```

This resulted in smooth transition between pages, and the best part
is that the HTML is still rendered on the server.

Oh, and if you are wondering if it will support other browsers, the
team also added a small ~3kb fallback script that is added to your
page automatically.

## Faster Rendering Performance

This is an internal change where the team removed as much unnecessary
code as much as possible from hot paths in the build pipeline and
optimized what remained. The team said that:

> Unnecessary generators and async code were two of the biggest culprits.

It resulted to 30% faster component renders. In [complex benchmarks][benchmarks]
the speed improvement can become as high as **75%**!

Which is amazing because the team did it really quickly because the optimization
started in Astro 2.10 which they shipped all of it in Astro 3.0.

## Image Optimization

As a user who has been using Astro since 1.0, this feature has been
the most worked on and the longest API to hit stable. But it is now
stable in 3.0.

It now uses `sharp` as the default optimization library because
`@squoosh/lib` is no longer maintained.

It adds the `Image` component and the `getImage` function which can
be imported in `astro:assets`

Example for the `Image` component:

```astro
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import myImage from '../assets/image.png';
---

<Image src={myImage} alt="A really cool looking image!" />
```

For the `getImage` function, I use it to optimize OpenGraph images:

```astro
---
import { getImage } from "astro:assets";
import myBackground from "../background.png"

const optimizedOGImage = await getImage({
  src: myBackground,
  width: 1200,
  height: 630,
  format: "jpeg",
});
const OGImageURL = new URL(optimizedOGImage.src, Astro.url.href);
---

<html>
  <head>
    <meta property="og:image" content={OGImageURL} />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- content... -->
  </body>
</html>
```

The images that were imported will automatically detect and
get optimized in the Astro build pipeline. The final rendered
image tag will be a native `img` tag with an inferred width
height added to prevent layout shift with automatic
[Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/cls/) protection.

It can also optimize remote images if needed.

## Astro ü§ù Vercel

Astro just partnered with Vercel as their hosting partner!
Honestly, I am not surprised, Vercel has always had keen eyes
for spotting good technology (buying Svelte, Turbo, SWC, etc.).

Although they didn't buy Astro, they did help out with enhancing
the SSR experience for the framework.

If you host your Astro site on Vercel today,
you will enjoy these benefits:

- Serverless Code Splitting
- Vercel's Image Optimization Service
- Edge Middleware

Make sure to add the `@astrojs/vercel` adapter to you
`astro.config.ts` to be able to use it.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';
// Import `@astrojs/vercel/static` if SSG is only used.
// import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/static';

// Remember to use output: 'static'
// if you are not using SSR
export default defineConfig({
  // output: 'static',
  output: 'server',
  adapter: vercel({
    edgeMiddleware: true,
    imagesConfig: {
      sizes: [320, 640, 1280]
      // rest of image config...
    }
    imageService: true
  }),
})
```

## HMR Enhancements for JSX

React Fast Refresh now works in Astro 3.0 because of an
internal refactoring of the JSX build support. This means
that framework integrations like React, Preact, Solid.js
users will see a significant improvement to Hot Module Reloading (HMR)
and overall dev server stability in Astro 3.0.

## Optimized Build Output

Small but very good improvements when your site is built are added
in this version:

- HTML Minification: Automatic HTML minification for smaller payload
  and faster response time.
- Component IDs: astro-XXXXXX class names have been replaced with a
  new, dedicated data-astro-cid-hash HTML attribute. Leaving the
  class="" attribute having a more readable, organized HTML output.
- CSS Inlining: Astro will now automatically inline small chunks of
  CSS into the HTML. This will improve page load performance compared
  to older versions where a page might load many smaller CSS files as
  separate requests from the browser.
