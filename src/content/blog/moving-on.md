> _Why do we keep holding on to things where there is no more left to hold on
> to?_

Maybe we are missing some things the person gave to us, maybe it is the
affection, the love, the offerings that they gave, the things that they said and
promised that you will do together that you made you smile.

Maybe we are missing them because, they didn't tell they were gonna leave us,
that they left without letting us know. Which can really hurt, especially if you
loved that person. Maybe that person was special to you that when they left in
an unexpected way hit you like a train. Why? Because you won't ever get to see
them anymore, you won't get to spend time with them like the way it used to be.

Maybe we are missing them because, you won't be able to laugh, smile at each
other, watch the latest episode of you favorite show together, watch movie, any
kind of movie, comedy, horror, romance, as long as you were spending time with
that person, it felt like the world was okay just for a moment, and all of the
problems that you were currently facing at that time, disappeared and the only
thing that you saw was that person.

But that's wrong, that was escaping from all of your problems, and you were
escaping it together with that person, we have to remember that this is not a
movie that we are in. This is real life, and in the real world not everything is
supposed to be happy. If it is always happy then life would be boring, and if
that person only stayed because of that reason, it will become inconvenient for
the both of you.

It was not right, but it was not wrong at the same time. At least, be thankful.

Be thankful that you met that person, because you made each other happy, you
made each other smile even when times were bad for the both of you. Atleast both
of you managed to smile and that was enough. Give yourself that closure.

> _What if those things are only said when both of you were at your happiest?_

That was excitement and the thrill that is first experienced when you talked to
that person. And when the two of those emotion dies, there is not much left to
talk about and not much to say to each other, because we expected that when we
spent time with that person, it was supposed to be all happiness and joy, and
everything is sunshine and a blue and clear sky.

In the real world, that is always not the case. In the real world, it rains and
it gets cloudy, but that doesn't mean that you are not going to go outside and
enjoy the rain and the beautiful formation of nimbus clouds. Rain is beautiful
because it reminds us that sometimes we have to experience rain, to be able to
see the rainbow that comes after it.

And if that wasn't the case for the both of you, then it is time for the both of
you, to probably stop now, because it won't be beneficial for you and for them
in the long run if you keep holding on to experience that feeling with that
person again, because that feeling will not be genuine.

But atleast, you get to spend time with them in your happiest moment in your
life, but this time, it's time for you, to spend time with yourself and be happy
by yourself. Because in the end, the only person that will love you
undconditionally, is yourself.

> _What if comforting words were not enough?_

Both of you tried.

Tried to comfort each other through words, in your lowest points. But that was
not enough for the both of you. Both of you wanted more, or maybe the other
person wanted more than just comforting words.

Yet you gave it to them, you gave them more than just the bare minimum,
sometimes more than what you are capable of, more of what you are allowed.

Maybe you even broke your own sets of rules just to be able to make that person
happy.

Maybe you loved that person more than you loved yourself.

And that was wrong, it should've been reciprocating. You should not love someone
to the point that you forget how to love yourself. Don't please that person or
entertain that person if they cannot provide the love that you gave to them
after everything that you went through.

Because in the end, when the relationship fails, you will be so broken because
you were expecting the love that you were giving, to be given back to that other
person. And that is wrong, because you should never expect, never expect because
you can't force them to give love.

> _How and why would you give love, when you can't even love yourself?_

You love someone, but you don't love yourself. You can't stand the fact that the
person you met, is perfect in your eyes. But what about you? Are you perfect? Do
you consider yourself to be enough, to be worthy of love? If not, then please do
not love someone first.

Because, when you get into a deep relationship with that other person. You will
just project your own insecurities to them. And that is not love, that is asking
for validation.

Why would you ask if you are enough to them? Why would you ask that person, if
you managed to pass their expectations and standards. When you yourself doesn't
even know that?

Love someone when you can love yourself, when you can love yourself to the point
that you do not need validation from others.

Love someone when you are happy with yourself, if you can be happy by being
alone, you can surely be happy to give your love to someone else, and not regret
if it didn't work out in the end. Because in the end, you can now say to
yourself, that you are just happy that you met them, and that you managed to
love them unconditionally, and you have made them happy.
