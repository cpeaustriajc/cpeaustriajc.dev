I can say that this month has not been the best for me, it threw me a lot of
challenges that tested my mental fortitude, it was really hard mentally and
physically.

Sometimes, there will come a time where you will have to make a big decision in
your life that will affect your future and what you will become as a person once
you have done it.

Though I really want to share the challenges that I have faced just within this
month, I will disclose them and keep it private because they are very personal,
and it involves a family matter.

We are not perfect beings, that is what makes us human, we won't live forever,
and things will change over time, maybe one day the person that you see the
most, will not be there anymore, one day they will disappear without you knowing
it.

So, cherish every moment, every second in your life, because one day everything
will change.
