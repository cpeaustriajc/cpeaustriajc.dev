					<p class="text-2xl">
						I started programming back in 2017 when messing around with game's overall
						graphics by modding as much as I can and implementing shaders to make it
						look good and add fancy effects.

					<h2 class="text-4xl my-8">Programming Philosophy üóø</h2>
					<p class="text-2xl">
						My main philosophy about programming is to make <strong
							>programming as simple as possible
						</strong>, The computer can only understand Ones and Zeros, there shouldn't
						be any kind of complex system or design that is working under the hood of a
						program that will make it harder than it is for the computer to understand.

					<h2 class="text-4xl my-8 font-bold">About</h2>
					<p>
						I am a student in Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng San Pablo that is passionate
						about programming.
					</p>

					<p>
						I am currently studying and taking a Bachelor's of Science in Computer
						Engineering (BSCpE). I am really fascinated about computers, the amount of
						things that you can do are almost limitless and I am always fascinated by
						the fact that these are only just a bunch of switches that turn on and off!
					</p>
					<p>
						Even though we only understand the basic components of them, we still need
						people to understand the underlying parts of it. This is where my college
						specialization shines.
					</p>
					<p>
						I love trying out different kinds of technologies and what are their limits
						and what can I do with them.

						<p>
							This is where I share my thoughts, devlogs, opinions, philosophy, etc.
						</p>
						<p>
							I learn a lot of things everyday, to retain my knowledge, I need to keep
							it somewhere where I can read it sometime.
						</p>
						<p>
							So what better place to store all of my personal learnings? Here in my
							personal site! I use Astro in it's full potential in this blog page!
