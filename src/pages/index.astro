				I started programming back in 2017 when messing around with game's overall graphics
				by modding as much as I can and implementing shaders to make it look good and add
				fancy effects.
			</p>

			<p>Nowadays, I do frontend development as I love to make good looking apps.</p>

			<p>
				My main philosophy about programming is to make <strong
					>programming as simple as possible
				</strong>, The computer can only understand Ones and Zeros, there shouldn't be any
				kind of complex system or design that is working under the hood of a program that
				will make it harder than it is for the computer to understand.

				I am a student in Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng San Pablo that is passionate about
				programming.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am currently studying and taking a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering
				(BSCpE). I am really fascinated about computers, the amount of things that you can
				do are almost limitless and I am always fascinated by the fact that these are only
				just a bunch of switches that turn on and off!
			</p>
			<p>
				Even though we only understand the basic components of them, we still need people to
				understand the underlying parts of it. This is where my college specialization
				shines.
			</p>
			<p>
				I love trying out different kinds of technologies and what are their limits and what
				can I do with them.
