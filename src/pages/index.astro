					<p class="text-2xl">
						I started programming back in 2017 when messing around with game's overall
						graphics by modding as much as I can and implementing shaders to make it
						look good and add fancy effects.

					<p class="text-2xl">
						My main philosophy about programming is to make <strong
							>programming as simple as possible
						</strong>, The computer can only understand Ones and Zeros, there shouldn't
						be any kind of complex system or design that is working under the hood of a
						program that will make it harder than it is for the computer to understand.

					</div>
					<div class="space-y-2">
						<p>
							I am a student in Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng San Pablo that is passionate
							about programming.
						</p>

						<p>
							I am currently studying and taking a Bachelor's of Science in Computer
							Engineering (BSCpE). I am really fascinated about computers, the amount
							of things that you can do are almost limitless and I am always
							fascinated by the fact that these are only just a bunch of switches that
							turn on and off!
						</p>
						<p>
							Even though we only understand the basic components of them, we still
							need people to understand the underlying parts of it. This is where my
							college specialization shines.
						</p>
						<p>
							I love trying out different kinds of technologies and what are their
							limits and what can I do with them.
