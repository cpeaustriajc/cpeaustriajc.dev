# Hey There!

My name is **John Carlo B. Austria**

I started programming back in 2017 when messing around with game's overall graphics by modding as
much as I can and implementing shaders to make it look good and add fancy effects.

Nowadays, I do frontend development as I love to make good looking apps.

My main philosophy about programming is to make **programming as simple as possible**, The computer
can only understand Ones and Zeros, there shouldn't be any kind of complex system or design that is
working under the hood of a program that will make it harder than it is for the computer to
understand.

## About

I am a student in Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng San Pablo that is passionate about programming.

I love trying out different kinds of technologies and what are their limits and what can I do with
them.
