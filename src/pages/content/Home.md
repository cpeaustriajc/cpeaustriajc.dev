# Hey There!

My name is **John Carlo B. Austria**

I started programming back in 2017 when messing around with game's overall graphics by modding as
much as I can and implementing shaders to make it look good and add fancy effects.

Nowadays, I do frontend development as I love to make good looking apps.

My main philosophy about programming is to make **programming as simple as possible**, The computer
can only understand Ones and Zeros, there shouldn't be any kind of complex system or design that is
working under the hood of a program that will make it harder than it is for the computer to
understand.

## About

I am a student in Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng San Pablo that is passionate about programming.

I am currently studying and taking a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCpE). I am
really fascinated about computers, the amount of things that you can do are almost limitless and I
am always fascinated by the fact that these are only just a bunch of switches that turn on and off!

Even though we only understand the basic components of them, we still need people to understand the
underlying parts of it. This is where my college specialization shines.

I love trying out different kinds of technologies and what are their limits and what can I do with
them.
