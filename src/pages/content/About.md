## Why I love tech

I am a student in Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng San Pablo that is passionate about programming.

I am currently studying and taking a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCpE). I am
really fascinated about computers, the amount of things that you can do are almost limitless and I
am always fascinated by the fact that these are only just a bunch of switches that turn on and off!

Even though we only understand the basic components of them, we still need people to understand the
underlying parts of it. This is where my college specialization shines.

I love trying out different kinds of technologies and what are their limits and what can I do with
them.
