## About Me

I am an ambitious computer engineering student at Pamantasan ng Lungsod
ng San Pablo with extensive programming experience dating back to 2016.

I am proficient in multiple languages including C#, TypeScript,
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with hands-on experience in modern frameworks
like Next.js, Blazor, Angular.

I began my programming journey with HLSL, which sparked my early interest
and aptitude in graphics programming. Combines academic knowledge with
practical coding skills, aiming to leverage this diverse technical
background to launch and grow a successful startup in the future.
