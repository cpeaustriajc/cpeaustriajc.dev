## Work Experience

**Converge ICT Solutions, Inc.**

Associate Software Engineer -- July 2024-September 2024

Currently working as a software engineering intern during summer
break where I built an internal application for the company to
use so that they can open franchises and manage tickets. The
project is still currently work in progress and currently
undergoing major changes.

Trying to complete all of the tasks given to me by my supervisor
within the timeframe of 450 hours. I strived to learn more about
the real world and corporate life by the help of the team at this
company.
