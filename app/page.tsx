      <p>
        I am a programmer based in Laguna, PH. I am currently studying at
        Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng San Pablo.

        I started programming in 2016 by playing around with computer graphics
        and creating shader configurations in various games. Since then, I
        learned multiple programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and
        tools.

        I am currently focusing on web development because I believe that the
        web is the future and investing in it is a good idea. I wanted to be a
        part of a community where there is something always new in the corner
        and something that hypes me up everytime.
